# File structure

## "Code" directory
This is the base area where all of the modeling work has been undertaken. The subdirectory Rcode contains the code for evaluating model results (and writes pdf files into “results” subdirectory).  Subdirectory “arc” is where the model stores results (and also contains previous versions of the jjm model code). 

Source code for ADMB (the assessment model) can be found in subdirector ADMB, R code is under the directory R.

In this directory, “run.bat” is a script that can be used to run models and place results in the code\arc directory.  E.g.:
"run s1"
will run the jjm model with s1.ctl file and store results in arc directory with "s1" as the root name in the code\arc directory.

## “Docs” directory
Contains the main documents used for the meeting. The subdirectories of this are self-explanatory.

## “Data” directory
Contains information from intersessional work and data submitted during the meeting.
