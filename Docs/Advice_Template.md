#Report on Biology, Stock Status and Management of Jack Mackerel (*Trachurus murphyii*): 2013 
The Scientific Committee (SC) conducted an assessment and review of fisheries indicators in 2013 to provide updated information on the status of the stock.  This report updates description of fisheries and the state of stock, and provides fishery and catch information. 

##1. Biology 
*[to pull from existing documents]*    

Jack mackerel (*Trachurus murphyii*) are found in the southern hemisphere, mainly in waters between 10° and 50° S 
with most concentrated abundances in the eastern Pacific.   
Their general distribution pattern with age is …
Jack mackerel can attain a length of over xx cm and a weight of over xkg. 
Direct ageing using otoliths indicates that a significant number of fish 
larger than xxcm are older than xx years, and the maximum age obtained from otolith readings has been xx years. 
Available data indicate jack mackerel mature beginning as early as xx years (XXcm fork length). 
Little is known or directly measured regarding jack mackerel natural mortality but estimates based on XX indicate
The extent and diversity of jack mackerel spawning grounds appears to vary over decades and whereas 
evidence exist for distinct populations, the current assessment approach has been to model fishing areas (generally) 
as “fleets” to account for different age structures available by region (selectivity is allowed to vary). 

##2. Description of Fisheries 
Reported catches of jack mackerel up to the end of 2012 are shown in Figure X. 
Historically, the jack mackerel stock has been exploited for more than XX years, 
with total catches peaking at xxt in 19xx. …

##3. Summary of Stock Status 
The recent assessments suggested that the jack mackerel spawning biomass is at a very low fraction of its 
original biomass as well as below the level that could produce maximum 
sustainable yield. Rebuilding the spawning stock biomass would almost certainly increase sustainable yield 
and provide security against unforeseen environmental events. 
The current TAC has been set based on the assessment which has a high probability increasing the stock.

### Stock prognosis
There is a positive outlook for the stock based on the 2013 assessment, including: 

-  a moderation of the total reported global catch;
-  the current fishing mortality has reduced to below Fmsy; and 
-  Stock is expected to increase at current catch levels, and future catch levels
